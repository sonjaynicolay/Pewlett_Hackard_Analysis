# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Preparing For The "Silver Tsunami"
#### Breaking Down The Approachhing Mass Eligible Retirees



**Overview of the analysis:** 

Pewlett Hackard knows an increase in hiring and recruiting will be needed in the near future, but how much? We research and find the amount employees who are at retirement age and/or will be eligible for retirement in the near future. To determine how to recruit and how many positions in each department and position will need to be filled, we break down the data into several smaller tables to reveal the information that will provide Pewlett Hackard with the information and data needed to efficiently prepare for the "Silver Tusnami".


**Results:** 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


**- First Thing's First**
To begin our research we created several tables of data from which we pulled our final results. This original list of tables are called our schemas. The schemas included the departments, employees, dept_manager, dept_emp, titles and salaries tables.

**-Number Of Employees Retiring at Each Position

Looking deeper we were able to determine how many employees will be retiring at each title or job position within Pewlett Hackard. Because the company is large the numbers are large. 29,414 will be eligible to retire at the Senior Engineer postion and 28,254 as Senior Staff. That is a good amount of Senior level staff for a company to lose all at once.




**Summary:** Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
