# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Preparing For The "Silver Tsunami"
#### Breaking Down The Approachhing Mass Eligible Retirees



**Overview of the analysis:** 

Pewlett Hackard knows an increase in hiring and recruiting will be needed in the near future, but how much? We research and find the amount employees who are at retirement age and/or will be eligible for retirement in the near future. To determine how to recruit and how many positions in each department and position will need to be filled, we break down the data into several smaller tables to reveal the information that will provide Pewlett Hackard with the information and data needed to efficiently prepare for the "Silver Tusnami".


**Results:** 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


**- First Thing's First**
To begin our research we had to create several tables of data from which we would pull results. This original list of tables are called our schemas.
