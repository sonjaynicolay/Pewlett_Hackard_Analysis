# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Preparing For The "Silver Tsunami"
#### Breaking Down The Approachhing Mass Eligible Retirees



**Overview of the analysis:** 

Pewlett Hackard knows an increase in hiring and recruiting will be needed in the near future, but how much? We research and find the amount employees who are at retirement age and/or will be eligible for retirement in the near future. To determine how to recruit and how many positions in each department and position will need to be filled, we break down the data into several smaller tables to reveal the information that will provide Pewlett Hackard with the information and data needed to efficiently prepare for the "Silver Tusnami".


**Results:** 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


**- First Thing's First**

To begin our research we created several tables of data from which we pulled our final results. This original list of tables are called our schemas. The schemas included the departments, employees, dept_manager, dept_emp, titles and salaries tables.

**-Number Of Employees Retiring at Each Position

Looking deeper we were able to determine how many employees will be retiring at each title or job position within Pewlett Hackard. Because the company is large, employees numbers and the numbers they will be losing are considerably large. 29,414 will be eligible to retire at the Senior Engineer postion and 28,254 as Senior Staff. That is a good amount of Senior level staff for a company to lose all at once.

**- Making Sure Data and Number are Accurate

It was very important for this analysis that we continously check and re-check data. Several new tables had to be created such as the unique titles table. The unique titles table removed multiple job titles for an individual and left us with the most recent job title for that individual. Steps, like this are extremely important to get down to the details Pewlett Hackard needs to accurately define who is retiring at what position.


**-The Mentorship Program**
Lastly we found the employees who will be eligible for the mentorship program. The individuals are employees who are approaching retirement born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. This list allows Pewlett Hackard to reach out to those individuals directly, using their employee numbers, about the Mentorship Program to help shape and develop the incoming pool of talent. If more employyes are willing to parcipate, Pewlett Hackard is able to hire more talent that is less experienced/younger but educated with the latest technologies. This also would allow the company to save a little on payroll. If not, they will have to hire more mid-highi level employees to replace the employees that are leaving those higher level positions immediately.

**Summary:** 

To summarize the analysis. Pewlett Hackard will be losing a lot of employees and needs to put together a hiring strategy immediately. They also need to put together a hiring budget and continue this analysis by including the total salaries made by dept of those retiring, so they can create a cap for hiring. Our analysis though thorough is still only a start and further analysis will need to be done to be more efficent.
